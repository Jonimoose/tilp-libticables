"add your user to a group such as 'usb' or set-up libusb mounting parameters."
"If packages of TiLP and its libraries for your distribution exist, it is "
"recommended to use those, as everything which can be configured "
"automatically will be set up for you. Otherwise, manual setup steps, if any, "
"are explained in the CONFIG file shipped with the ticables2 library. "
