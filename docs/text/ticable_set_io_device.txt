Type=Function
Header=cabl_int.h
Definition=void ticable_set_io_device(char *device);

[Parameters]
device : the device to use.

[Summary]
Set the device to use for link cable access.

[Description]
The @device string contains the name of a device. Depending on the platform,
the string can be "COM1", ..., "/dev/ttyS0", ...

Usually, this field is left to "" unless you specify USER_PORT as an abstract 
port to use. Indeed, the device is automatically determined by library.

The change will come into effect on the next call to @ticable_set_cable@.

Note: if you need to change more than one link cable parameter at a time, you
should consider the @ticable_set_param@ function.
