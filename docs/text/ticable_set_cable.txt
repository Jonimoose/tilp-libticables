[Parameters]
type : the link cable model.
lc : a structure for handling the link cable.

[Summary]
Set a link cable model and set the structure used to handling it.

[Description]
The function will fill the lc structure according to the link cable model you
chosen by type.

It will also automagically determine the best I/O access method to use (I/O, 
driver, ...) for the link cable as well as the hardware port to use (serial,
parallel, USB) and its settings.

Note: the link cable parameters _must_ be set before calling this function. Use @ticable_set_param@.
