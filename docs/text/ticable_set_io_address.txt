Definition=void ticable_set_io_address(unsigned int address)

[Parameters]
address : a valid I/O address to use.

[Summary]
Set the I/O address to use for link cable access.

[Description]
Be careful: an incorrect value can provoke strange behaviour, mouse lockup or
even worse !

The address parameter contains a valid I/O port address. It can be 0x378 for
the first parallel port (LPT1 or /dev/lp0), or 0x3f8 (COM1), or ...

Usually, this field is left to 0 unless you specify USER_PORT as an abstract 
port to use. Indeed, the device is automatically determined by library.

The change will come into effect on the next call to @ticable_set_cable@.

Note: if you need to change more than one link cable parameter at a time, you
should consider the @ticable_set_param@ function.
