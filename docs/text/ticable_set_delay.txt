Type=Function
Header=cabl_int.h
Definition=void ticable_set_delay(int delay)

[Parameters]
delay : the inter-bit delay in micro-seconds.

[Summary]
Set the inter-bit delay for home-made and BlackLink cables.

[Description]
The inter-bit delay is a very small tempo (few micro-seconds) inserted between
each rises of the signal so that electrical signal can stabilize it.

The higher the value is, better the reliability is.
The lower the value is, faster the cable is.
A value of 7µs is a good compromise.

Note: 
<br>- the change will come into effect on the next call to @ticable_set_cable@.
<br>- if you need to change more than one link cable parameter at a time, you
should consider the @ticable_set_param function@.
