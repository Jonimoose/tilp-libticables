[Fields]
int calc_type : calculator type.
@TicableLinkType@ link_type : link cable type.
unsigned int io_addr : I/O address of a serial or parallel port.
char device[1024] : the name of a device.
int timeout : timeout value in tenth of seconds.
int delay : inter-bit delay in micro-seconds.
@TicableBaudRate@ baud_rate : serial baud-rate for GreyLink/AVRlink cables.
@TicableHfc@ hfc : hardware flow control.
@TicablePort@ port : abstract port to use.
@TicableMethod@ method : abstract method to use.

[Summary]
Structure used to setup the link cable characteristics.

[Description]
This structure, usually passed to the @ticable_set_param@ function, is used to
set up some characteristics of a link cable such as:
<br>- I/O address to use (if needed),
<br>- a device to use (if needed),
<br>- the timeout value (common to all cables),
<br>- the inter-bit delay value (home-made cables),
<br>- the baud-rate (AVRlink only),
<br>- the use of hardware flow control (AVRlink only),
<br>- which port to use (hardware independant),
<br>- which I/O access to use (IOM_AUTO usually).
<br>
This structure does not specify a link model. Use @ticable_set_cable@ instead.
