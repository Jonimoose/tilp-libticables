   Library v0.0.9            by Romain Liévin


Persons who want reuse this library (Linux, Windows, Mac OS-X, FreeBSD)
can take a look at the doc directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development platform: 

  - Linux Debian Potatoe, 2.6.x kernel

  - Windows 95/98/Me & Windows NT4/2000/XP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - A UNIX computer and C compiler (gcc) for the Linux version
or
  - A *BSD (FreeBSD) computer and C compiler (gcc)

  - parallel link: your kernel must have parport support (PARPORT, PARPORT_PC 
	and PPDEV) and the /dev/parportX device must have required permissions.

  - BlackLink: the /dev/ttySx device must have required permissions.

  - GrayLink: idem.

  - SilverLink: your kernel must have USB device file-system and your system 
	must have lib-usb properly installed and configured (USB fs must be
	mounted). For ease of use, use the 'root' account.
	Else, see the libusb documentation for more details.

	Otherwise, you will find below a quick overview which applies to
	Debian systems:
<<
libusb uses a pseudo-filesystem known as 'usbdevfs` or 'usbfs` to access
the USB devices connected to your machine. This filesystem must be mounted
under /proc/bus/usb for libusb to work.

It could be done using the following command:
        mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

An alternative and more permanent method would be to add
        none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults 0 0
to your /etc/fstab file. It will mount the usbfs for you automatically at
boot time ; only root will be able to access the USB devices with this
setup.

Several mount options are available, that allow you to set the permissions
on the files created under /proc/bus/usb so that non-root users can use
libusb applications:
 - devuid=xxx, devgid=xxx, devmode=xxx respectively set the uid, the gid
   and the mode of the devices files, ie /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD
 - busuid=xxx, busgid=xxx, devmode=xxx respectively set the uid, the gid
   and the mode of the bus files, ie /proc/bus/usb/BBB
 - listuid=xxx, listgid=xxx, listmode=xxx respectively set the uid, the gid
   and the mode of /proc/bus/usb/devices

 -- Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>, Sun, 21 Mar 2004 01:01:44 +0100

Clearly, add this to you fstab:
	none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults,rw,listuid=1000,listgid=1000,devuid=1000,devgid=1000,busuid=1000,busgid=1000
>>

	Fedora is set up differently. For one, /proc/bus/usb (or /dev/bus/usb
	as it is now called, but /proc/bus/usb still works as of Fedora Core 6)
	isn't mounted as a file system. (It's apparently taken care of by udev.)
	And secondly, you don't have to play with the permissions, because a
	nice tool called pam_console takes care of that for you. (The user
	physically in front of the computer, if any, gets access to what's
	assumed to be his/her calculator automatically.) The libticables2 Fedora
	RPM automatically installs the required udev and pam_console
	configurations for a regular user to be able to access the linked
	calculator (when logged in locally).

	To sum up, USB links Just Work in Fedora without any manual user
	intervention, as long as my Fedora RPMs are used. -- Kevin Kofler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Untar the libticables-X.X.X.tar.gz archive (tar -xvzf),
change directory to libticables directory.

Type "./configure"

Type "make", "make install" (requires the root privileges).

Note: some cable handlers can be disabled thru #define NO_CABLE_XXX.
